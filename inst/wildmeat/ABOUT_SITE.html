<p style="text-align:justify"><b><h4>Aquatic Wild Meat</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals <a href="http://www.cms.int/">(CMS)</a>, also known as the Bonn Convention, defines <i>Aquatic Wild Meat</i> as the "products derived from wild aquatic mammals, birds and reptiles that are used for human consumption and other non-food purposes such as traditional medicines". It is obtained opportunistically (e.g., from bycatch or strandings) or from illegal or unregulated hunts.<br><br>
Illegal and unregulated hunting of aquatic megafauna (e.g., aquatic mammals) for human consumption and other uses constitutes a substantial and immediate threat to many species worldwide. The aim of The Aquatic Wild Meat Database Project is to create a global database on aquatic mammal utilisation. The data is displayed both a as global map as well as individual trend graphs for each country. We expect the project to allow scientists and non-scientists, such as policy makers and the general public, to better visualise the global extent of aquatic mammal utilisation. It also will help to:<br>
<br>
a. Identify understudied areas and those of greater concern.<br>
b. Create an online network of different stakeholders working on aquatic wild meat(e.g., Google group).<br>
c. Collect anecdotal records that are rarely published, by allowing users from all over the world to contribute to the database using a simple form.<br>
d. Identify areas where opportunistic utilisation (e.g., from bycatch and strandings) led to directed catches.<br>
e. Identify trends in aquatic mammals utilisation. <br>
