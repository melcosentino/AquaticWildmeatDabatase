<b><h4>App development</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">This application was created in the environment R, using RStudio version 1.0.136, making use of the package "shiny", which allows interactive web applications to be built with R. The database itself is an SQLite database. SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine, which allows to store millions of records.</p> 
<br>
<b><h4>Data Collection</h4></b>
<p style="text-align:justify">The database contains the following fields: city/area, state, country, species, scientific name, genus, family, order, class, how the animal was obtained (i.e. origin), how the animal was utilised, number of animals used, year of the event, year when the record was published, whether there was trade (i.e., yes/no, local, regional or international). If international trade is taking place, then the country of origin and country of destination are recorded.</p>
<br>
<i>Literature search</i>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">A thorough literature search of published and unpublished materials available online was conducted in English, Spanish, and French. The search included videos, news, and local organization websites. Further information was also obtained by contacting individual authors and organisations.</p> 
<br>
<i>Citizen science</i>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">The application includes a simple form that researchers and the public can use to introduce data into the database. The form is placed in the tab 'Forms', which in turn has three subtabs: 'Single records', 'Ancient records', and 'Contact person'. 'Single records' allows the user to submit information about events (from not earlier than 1945) in which small cetaceans were utilised as wild meat. The form has several mandatory fields, including 'Use' (e.g., food, bait, medicine), as well as 'Name' and 'Email' so that the contributor can be contacted if there are issues with the information provided. In addition, contributors can upload images and any additional document they consider to be relevant to the event they are reporting.<br>
The tab 'Contact person' allow users, through a simple form, to provide contact details of themselves or other individuals that work in areas where they encounter (regularly or occasionally) utilisation of small cetaceans. This will help create a network of different stakeholders working on aquatic wild meat.<br>
The tab 'Ancient records' is currently under construction.</p>
<br>
<i>Contributors - Researchers and organisations</i>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Contributors can provide data in different ways, either through the form as explained above, or by sending their database to the app managers (see Data ownership).</p> 
<br>
<b><h4>Data ownership</h4></b>

<p style="text-align:justify">Contributors are encouraged to sign a data use agreement where it is clearly stated that the data provided by the contributors can be used only for the purpose of centralising the data in a single database and display it in the Aquatic Wild Meat Database application online. The data will not be available for download and will not be distributed to third parties. If a third party approaches the application managers, these will act as an intermediary with the contributor.</p>
