<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Long-finned pilot whale (<i>Globicephala melas</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Short-finned pilot whales can be found in North Atlantic waters as well as in temperate and subantarctic waters in the southern hemisphere. They belong to the <i>Delphinidae</i> family yet their size and behaviour differs from other oceanic dolphins. They are black except for a greyish area in the ventral part as well as behind the dorsal fin. They are similar to short-finned pilot whales but larger, with females reaching 5.7 m in length while males reach up to 6.7 m. They live in matrilineal groups of between 8 and 12 individuals, spending most of their time together. IUCN = Data Deficient.
