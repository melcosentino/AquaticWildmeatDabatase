<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Gervais' beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon europaeus</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Gervais' beaked whales appears to be warm temperate and tropical waters, distributed in deep waters across the tropical and temperate Atlantic Ocean, both north and south of the equator. They are the largest of the mesoplodonts and rather gracile, elongated, and laterally compressed compared with the others. The mouthline is remarkably straight, even in males, and the two teeth of the male erupt towards the tip of the beak, and are hardly noticeable. They are dark gray on top and lighter gray on bottom, though juveniles have a lighter coloration. Adult females can reach 5.2 m and weigh more than 1,2 tons, while males are slightly smaller (4.5 m). IUCN = Data Deficient. Learn more about Gervais' beaked whales <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/13245/3427527" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
