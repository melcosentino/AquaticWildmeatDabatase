<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>White-beaked dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus albirostris</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify"> White-beaked dolphins are found in cold waters in the Northern Hemisphere, in oceanic waters. They are small, reaching up to 3.1 m and have a short beak. The colouration is similar to other dolphins, with the upper body and flanks being darker than the ventral area. The beak is usually white, but it may be a dark, ashy grey, in older individuals. They are usually found in groups of fewer than 10 individuals but occasionally gather in large groups. White-sided dolphins are taken for food throughout their distribution range. IUCN = Least Concern. Learn more about white-sided dolphins <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11142/50361346" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
