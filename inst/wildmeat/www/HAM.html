<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Northern bottlenose whale (<i>Hyperoodon ampullatus</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Northern bottlenose whales can be found in the North Atlantic Ocean and populations are found in the deep (>500 m) cold waters. Population is estimated to be between 10,000 and 45,000 animals, although it is very poorly studied species. They are big animals, adults can reach 9.8 metres in length and weigh between 5.8â€“7.5 tons.There is sexual dimorphism in this species. Males have two small teeth, which erupt at the front end of the bottom jaw, and have larger, flattened or square shape melons. Females and juveniles, on the other hand, have rounder, smaller melons. Their backs are mid-to-dark grey with a lighter underside. Melon coloration can vary, though it appears the head of most males becomes more white or buff colored when they are older.
