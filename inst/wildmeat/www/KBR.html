<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Pygmy sperm whale (<i>Kogia breviceps</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify"> Pygmy sperm whales are small, with adults measure about 3.5 metres in length and weigh about 400 kg. The underside is a creamy, occasionally pinkish colour and the back and sides are a bluish grey; however, considerable intermixing occurs between the two colours. The shark-like head is large in comparison to body size, given an almost swollen appearance when viewed from the side. A whitish marking, often described as a "false gill", is seen behind each eye. Pygmy sperm whales are found throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and occasionally among colder waters such as off Russia. However, they are considered a rare species, and most data comes from stranded animals. IUCN = Least Concern. Learn more about pygmy sperm whales
