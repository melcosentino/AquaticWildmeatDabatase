<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Sowerby's beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon bidens</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Little is known about the Sowerby's beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens) even though they were first described in 1804. They are found in the North Atlantic Ocean in offshore, deep waters. As other beaked whales, they have only 2 teeth and the dorsal fin is located in the third part of their bodies. Unlike other species in the genus, their beak is long enough to be a distinctive characteristic when identifying species in the wild. They are dark in the dorsal area and lighter in the ventral side, reaching over 5m in length. Sowerbyâ€™s beaked whales travel in small groups of 8 to 10 individuals, and spent much of their time away from the surface, being able to dive for over 30 min. IUCN = Data Deficient.
