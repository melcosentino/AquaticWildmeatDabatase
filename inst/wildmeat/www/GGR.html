<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Risso's dolphin (<i>Grampus griseus</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Risso's dolphins can be found in all warm and temperate waters around the world in coastal and offshore areas. They are easy to identify due to two factors. Their head is unique in that it has a vertical frontal crease and they accumulate their scars for life. Thus, adult males are mostly white, adult females much less scarred, and calves and juveniles are light grey with little or no scarring. Their social structure is mostly unknown but males form groups, spending most of their time together and only join female-calf groups for mating purposes. IUCN = Least Concern.
