<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Atlantic white-sided dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus acutus</i>)</h4></b> 

<p style="text-align:justify">Atlantic white-sided dolphins are found in cool and temperate waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. They are usually found in oceanic waters, but are sometimes seen in coastal areas. They are small, reaching between 2.5 and 2.8 m in length, and live in large groups of about 60 animals, and occasionally meet in groups that can reach thousands of individuals. Atlantic white-sided dolphins reach sexual maturity at around 7-11 years of age and live between 22 (males) and 27 years (females). They have a characteristic coloration, different to any other cetacean. They have a white to pale yellow patch found behind the dorsal fin of the dolphin on each side. They used to be killed for food in Norway and Newfoundland and are now occasionally taken in the Faroe Islands. Pollution is also a cause of concern for their long term survival. IUCN = Least Concern. Learn more about Atlantic white-sided dolphins <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11141/3255721" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
