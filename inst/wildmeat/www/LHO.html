<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Fraser's dolphin (<i>Lagenodelphis hosei</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Fraser's dolphins or Sarawak dolphins can reach 2.75 metres in length and 200 kg when they are adults. They have a stocky build, a small fin in relation to the size of the body, conspicuously small flippers, as well as their dorsal fin and beak. The upper side is a gray-blue to gray-brown. A dirty cream colored line runs along the flanks from the beak, above the eye, to the anus. There is a dark stripe under this line. The belly and throat are usually white, sometimes tinged pink. They live in deep waters in the Pacific Ocean and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. IUCN = Least Concern.
