<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>IGE - Amazon river dolphin (<i>Inia geoffrensis</i>)</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Amazon river dolphins, also known as the botos, bufeos or pinks river dolphin, is the largest species of river dolphin, with adult males reaching 185 kilograms in weight, and 2.5 metres in length. Adults acquire a pink color, being more prominent in males than females. They have long pectoral fins and the dorsal fin is short in height, although is regarded as long. Their distribution range is throughout the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. They have a long, thin rostrum, with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws. Dentition is heterodont, meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length, with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey. IUCN = Endangered.
