<p style="text-align:justify"><br><b><h4>Lucrecia Souviron Priego</h4></b> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Lucrecia is a biologist working on different conservation issues. After finishing her Degree in Biology, she completed a Master's Degree in Wildlife Research and Hunting Resources at the University Institute of Wildlife Research (Spain). She is currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.uma.es/" target="_blank">University of Malaga</a> (Spain) and her project is focused on the international wildlife trade worldwide. The questions she is trying to answer include which animal species are more demanded, what are they mainly used for (e.g., pet trade, traditional medicine or ornament), and what is the role of each country in this business as well as the consequences of trading exotic animals (i.e., the threat to these animals in their native environments and the introduction of invasive species).
